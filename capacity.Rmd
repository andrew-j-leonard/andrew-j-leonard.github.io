This example uses [Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) to solve an optimization problem common in supply chain.

More specifically, this document is a demonstration of how to use Google OR Tools to solve a [Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Window and Resource Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) in Python.

This example closely follows the [Python examples in the documentation for OR tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/examples) using the [Routing Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/constraint_solver/pywrapcp?hl=en).
