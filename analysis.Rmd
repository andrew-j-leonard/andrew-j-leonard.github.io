## Overview

This document will provide a comparison of the [US EIA's Oil Production data](https://andrew-j-leonard.github.io/oil.html) and the [USDA's CRP Enrollment data](https://andrew-j-leonard.github.io/crp.html) using R Markdown, Tabeau Public, and Linear Regression models. Please refer to the other pages in this site in order to learn how to extract, clean, and save this data locally.

I began my career working in the ag commodities market in 2015.  At the time, the [price of oil was plunging](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/what-triggered-oil-price-plunge-2014-2016-and-why-it-failed-deliver-economic-impetus-eight-charts#:~:text=The%20initial%20drop%20in%20oil,concerns%2C%20and%20shifting%20OPEC%20policies.&text=This%20partly%20explains%20why%20the,subsequent%20boost%20to%20global%20activity.) due to the increase in US shale oil production - obviously this had an [impact on the price of agricultural commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030415/how-does-price-oil-affect-stock-market.asp) as well. 

The practice used in shale oil production is known as [hydraulic fracturing](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-hydraulic-fracturing?qt-news_science_products=0#) AKA "fracking" which has been around [since the late 1980's](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/when-did-hydraulic-fracturing-become-such-a-popular-approach-oil-and-gas-production?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products).  Fracking can be a controversial subject because of its [effects on the environment](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-environmental-issues-are-associated-hydraulic-fracturing?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) so I was curious what other facets of agriculture could be affected by shale oil production.

## CRP Data

Let's begin the analysis by loading the necessary packages in R.
```{r}
library("data.table")
library("htmltools")
library("ggplot2")
suppressMessages(library("here"))
```

Load the [CRP data](https://andrew-j-leonard.github.io/crp.html) saved in the CSV file and view it.
```{r}
crp_fname <- here("Data", "usda_crp_enrollment.csv")
crp_dt <- fread(crp_fname)
head(crp_dt)
```

Let's rank states by the quantity of acres enrolled for the most recent date.  
```{r}
# Start by creating a column for the max year by state.
crp_dt[, max_year := max(year), by = state]
# Then filter where year is equal to max year.
max_crp_dt <- crp_dt[year == max_year]
# now order the data by acres (descending)
setorder(max_crp_dt, -acres)
# create a number for each row
max_crp_dt[, rank := .I]
# check top 10 rows
head(max_crp_dt, 10)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
read_html <- function(html_fname) {
  html_fname <- here(html_fname)
  includeHTML(html_fname)
}
```

I created a dashboard in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AcresEnrolledinCRP/dashAllStates?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) which you can interact with below:
```{r}
read_html("crp_all_states.html")
```

<br/>

## Oil Data

Now let's load our [oil production data](https://andrew-j-leonard.github.io/oil.html) and view it.
```{r}
oil_fname <- here("Data", "eia_oil_production.csv")
oil_dt <- fread(oil_fname)
head(oil_dt)
```

The oil data is aggregated by month by default so we need to aggregate it by year in order to join the data with our CRP data later.
```{r}
oil_dt <- oil_dt[, .(sum_barrel = sum(barrel), avg_barrels_per_day = mean(barrels_per_day)), by = .(state_abb, state, year)]
head(oil_dt)
```

I created another dashboard in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/USEIAOilProduction/dashAllStatesOil?:language=en-US&:retry=yes&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) except using oil data which you can interact with below.
```{r}
read_html("oil_all_states.html")
```

<br/>

The states we're primarily interested in are TX, ND, SD, CO, MT, NE, NM, WY, PA, WV, OH, NY, LA, OK, and AR.

## Compare 

Let's rank states by the quantity of oil produced for the most recent year that is present in both sets of data.
```{r}
max_year <- min(max(oil_dt$year), max(crp_dt$year))
max_oil_dt <- oil_dt[year == max_year]
setorder(max_oil_dt, -sum_barrel)
max_oil_dt[, rank := .I]
head(max_oil_dt, 10)
```

Let's compare that to the ranking for CRP.
```{r}
head(max_crp_dt, 10)
```


Let's go ahead and filter our oil data for only these states.
```{r}
fracking_states <- c("TX", "ND", "SD", "CO", "MT", "NE", "NM", "WY", "PA", "WV", "OH", "NY", "LA", "OK", "AR")
oil_dt <- oil_dt[state_abb %in% fracking_states]
```

I created another dashboard in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AcresEnrolledinCRP/dashFrackingStates?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for CRP data in fracking states only which you can interact with below:
```{r}
read_html("crp_fracking_states.html")
```

<br/>

And I did the same thing using oil data in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/USEIAOilProduction/dashFrackingStatesOil?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
```{r}
read_html("oil_fracking_states.html")
```
<br/>

## Linear Regression Model

Now join the CRP and Oil Production data and compare the two variables using linear regression.
```{r}
# Note - inner join filters both tables
DT <- merge(oil_dt, crp_dt, by = c("state", "year"))
DT <- DT[, .(avg_barrels_per_day = mean(avg_barrels_per_day), 
             acres = sum(acres)), 
         by = year]
ggplot(DT, aes(x = avg_barrels_per_day, y = acres)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x)
```

We can see there are a couple of outliers.  Since fracking didn't start until the 1980's, let's filter out dates before 1990 and plot the linear model again.
```{r}
DT <- DT[year >= 1990]
ggplot(DT, aes(x = avg_barrels_per_day, y = acres)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x) +
  labs(y = "Acres Enrolled in CRP", x = "Avg Barrel per Day (1000's)")
```

Much better!  Now we can see there is a distinct linear trend between the number of acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program and the average quantity (1,000's barrels) of oil produced within the same states.

```{r include = FALSE}
r_squared <- cor(DT$avg_barrels_per_day, DT$acres)**2 * 100
r_squared <- round(r_squared, 2)
r_squared <- as.character(r_squared)
```

More precisely, `r r_squared`% of the variance in the acres enrolled in CRP can be explained by the variance in the average number of barrels of crude produced in these same states according to our model. 
```{r}
mod <- lm(acres ~ avg_barrels_per_day, DT)
summary(mod)
```

## Log-Linear Regression Model

But can we do better?  Note that the values for our dependent variable (Acres Enrolled in CRP) are much larger than the values for our independent variable (Avg Barrel per Day in 1000's).  Let's try taking the [natural log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm) of our dependent variable to improve the scale and plot the new values in a log-linear model.

```{r}
DT[, ln_acres := log(acres)]
ggplot(DT, aes(x = avg_barrels_per_day, y = ln_acres)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
  labs(y = "LN(Acres Enrolled in CRP)", x = "Avg Barrel per Day (1000's)")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
r_squared <- cor(DT$avg_barrels_per_day, DT$ln_acres)**2 * 100
r_squared <- round(r_squared, 2)
r_squared <- as.character(r_squared)
```

Now let's check the log-linear model.
```{r}
mod <- lm(ln_acres ~ avg_barrels_per_day, DT)
summary(mod)
```

Not bad. We can see the log-linear model is a little better than the linear model.  According to our log-linear model, `r r_squared`% of the variance in the natural log of acres enrolled in CRP can be explained by the variance in the average number of barrels of crude produced in these same states. 

## Log-Log Regression Model

But what if we take the natural log of our independent variable as well and compare the values using a log-log model?
```{r}
DT[, ln_avg_barrels_per_day := log(avg_barrels_per_day)]
ggplot(DT, aes(x = ln_avg_barrels_per_day, y = ln_acres)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
  labs(y = "LN(Acres Enrolled in CRP)", x = "LN(Avg Barrel per Day (1000's))")
```

And let's create the log-log model.
```{r}
mod <- lm(ln_acres ~ ln_avg_barrels_per_day, DT)
summary(mod)
```

And check the residuals - they appear to be approximately normally distributed.
```{r}
.residuals <- mod$residuals
hist(.residuals)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
r_squared <- cor(DT$ln_avg_barrels_per_day, DT$ln_acres)**2 * 100
r_squared <- round(r_squared, 2)
r_squared <- as.character(r_squared)
```

According to our log-log model `r r_squared`% of the variance in the natural log of acres enrolled in CRP can be explained by the variance in the natural log of average number of barrels of crude produced in these same states. 

```{r include = FALSE}
slope_coeff <- round(mod$coefficients[[2]] * 100, 2)
increase_decrease_str <- if (slope_coeff < 0) "decrease" else "increase"
```

Furthermore, since this is a [log-log model](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-do-i-interpret-a-regression-model-when-some-variables-are-log-transformed/) we know that the slope coefficient is the [elasticity](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56614010/8623742).  Therefore, according to our log-log model, a 100% increase in the Avg Barrel Produced per Day in 1000's will result in an approximate `r slope_coeff`% `r increase_decrease_str` in Acres Enrolled in CRP.
